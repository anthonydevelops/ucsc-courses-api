# Unofficial UCSC Courses API

An **Unofficial** API for UCSC that gathers all course & professor data all in one repo and makes it easy to get the semi-latest information.

## Requirements

- NodeJS (stable is fine)
- NPM (stable is fine)
- Git (2^)

## Setup

```javascript
// Installation
git clone https://github.com/anthonydevelops/ucsc-courses-api
cd ucsc-courses-api/
npm install

// Run server on localhost
npm run main
```

## Contribution

Contributions are always welcome and keep in mind that this is in **active** development. Thanks!

## To-Do

- Get API up-and-running
- Implement test framework (like yesterday)
- Create crawler that'll fetch new information once a month
